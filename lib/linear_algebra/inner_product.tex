\Lemma{Inner products with zero goes to zero}\label{f9096e1}

Let $V$ be an \href{b9935c8}{inner product space}. Then for all $v\in V$, we
have
$$
  \inner0v=\inner v0=0
$$

\begin{proof}
  Since $0+0=0$ in all vector spaces, we have
  \begin{align*}
    \inner0v &=\inner{0+0}v                                 \\
             &=\inner0v+\inner0v\desc{linearity in 1st arg}
  \end{align*}

  And hence $\inner 0v=0$. By conjugate symmetry of inner products, we also
  have $\inner v0=0$.
\end{proof}
