\Lemma{Gram-Schmidt and linear combination of original basis}\label{eead63c}

Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional vector space, and let $\{\iter{v_1}{v_n}\}$ be a
basis of $V$. Let $\{\iter{u_1}{u_n}\}$ be the result of applying the
Gram-Schmidt process on $\{\iter{v_1}{v_n}\}$.

Then $u_i$ is a linear combination of $\{\iter{v_1}{v_i}\}$, for each
$i=\iter1n$.

\begin{proof}
  \def\proj{\mathrm{proj}}

  We prove this statement by strong induction. Let $P(i)$ be the statement that
  $u_i$ is a linear combination of $\{\iter{v_1}{v_i}\}$. Note that $P(1)$ is
  trivially true, since $u_1:=v_1$.

  Let $P(k)$ be true for some $k\in[1,n-1]$. Now by construction,
  $$
    u_{k+1}=v_{k+1}-\sum_{i=1}^k\proj_{u_i}(v_{k+1})
  $$

  where $\proj_a(b)$ is the \href{fc332ef}{vector projection} of $b$ onto $a$.
  Therefore, $u_{k+1}$ is a linear combination of $v_{k+1}$ and
  $\iter{u_1}{u_k}$. But by strong induction, for each $i=\iter1k$, $u_i$ is a
  linear combination of $\iter{v_1}{v_i}$ and hence the linear combination of
  $\iter{u_1}{u_k}$ is a linear combination of $\iter{v_1}{v_k}$.

  Therefore, $u_{k+1}$ is a linear combination of $\iter{v_1}{v_{k+1}}$. This
  completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\Lemma{Gram-Schmidt on a basis does not produce zeros}\label{c4f05ae}

Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional vector space, and let $\{\iter{v_1}{v_n}\}$ be a
basis of $V$. Then applying the Gram-Schmidt process on $\{\iter{v_1}{v_n}\}$
to obtain $\{\iter{u_1}{u_n}\}$ will not result in $u_i=0$ for any $i=\iter1n$.

\begin{proof}
  \def\proj{\mathrm{proj}}

  Let $\proj_a(b)$ be the \href{fc332ef}{vector projection} of $b$ onto $a$.
  Then by construction,
  $$
    u_k=v_k-\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}\proj_{u_i}(v_k)\with{(k=\iter1n)}
  $$

  Assume on the contrary that for some $k$, we have $u_k=0$. Then
  $$
    0=v_k-\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}\proj_{u_i}(v_k)
  $$

  This is simplying saying that there is a collection of scalars $a_i$ such
  that
  $$
    0=v_k-\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}a_iu_i
  $$

  By \autoref{eead63c}, each $u_i$ is a linear combination of
  $\iter{v_1}{v_i}$, and hence there is also a collection of scalars $b_i$ such
  that
  $$
    0=v_k-\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}b_iv_i
  $$

  By \href{c133a44}{linear independence} of $\iter{v_1}{v_k}$, the RHS must be
  the trivial linear combination of $\iter{v_1}{v_k}$, but this is a
  contradiction as the coefficient of $v_k$ is $1$.
\end{proof}

\Lemma{Gram-Schmidt produces a basis that spans the same space}\label{c39f052}

Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional vector space, and let $\{\iter{v_1}{v_n}\}$ be a
basis of $V$. Let $\{\iter{u_1}{u_n}\}$ be the result of applying the
Gram-Schmidt process on $\{\iter{v_1}{v_n}\}$. Then $\{\iter{u_1}{u_n}\}$ is
also a basis of $V$.

\begin{proof}
  By construction, $\{\iter{u_1}{u_n}\}$ are set of orthogonal vectors.
  \autoref{c4f05ae} guarantees that none of them are zeros, and by
  \href{c0eb6f5} this result, they are linearly independent.

  By \autoref{c8f8fd3}, they span $V$.
\end{proof}
